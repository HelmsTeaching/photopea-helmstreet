## ALT
Complex edited image with multiple layers featuring a cartoon blind woman with a seeing-eye dog and cane. She is walking across the text of a web page. The dog looks concerned. Across this a stock image of a frayed rope has been placed. At one end of the rope is the word "ME" (distorted) and on the other end, "WE" (not distorted). 

## Discussion
I was trying to put these two quotes into conversation:
"alt attributes should describe the image, title attributes should explain the rhetorical use of the image." (Eyman, et al.)
"Universalization erases difference and produces self-reinforcing spirals of exclusion, but personalized and culturally adaptive systems too often are deployed in ways that reinforce surveillance capitalism." (Costanza-Chock)
The first gives a universalist principle, while the second points to the tensions between universalist and individualist design. Additionally, I was thinking about Cheryl Ball and Ryan Moeller's point about the inability to separate form and content (or description and rhetoric to link more directly to Eyman, et al.'s words). In what sense is the alt-text I've written above NOT rhetorical?
